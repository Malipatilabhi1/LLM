ArrowHYPERAUTOMATION FAQS


What is Hyperautomation?
Hyperautomation is a holistic solution for the digital transformation of operational business processes through a collaborative convergence of technologies and strategies. It includes automating as many processes and tasks as possible in an organization. It is an intelligent integration of tools/technologies like RPA, Big Data and AI/ML, combined with digital and dynamic workflows, using iBPMS and a low-code/no-code development environment. These technologies are used by businesses to automate processes without requiring human intervention.

Gartner states that hyperautomation is an unavoidable market state. It has also been coined by Gartner as one of the top technology trends in 2022.

How is it different from Automation?
Typically, automation occurs at a smaller scale, addressing individual tasks with solutions. The term hyperautomation, however, refers to the use of several automated tools to automate tasks in order to achieve automation scales, such as machine learning and robotic process automation. Organizations today are looking to move beyond automation efforts to become more agile and resilient.

Hyperautomation emerged as there was a need for a more deliberate, organization-wide disciplined approach to automation, beyond automating business processes in silos. Hyperautomation is an extension of automation with an added layer of intelligence that allows machines or technologies and humans to work together to provide clients with value-centric services. Hyperautomation is also less expensive than other automation systems, which have a substantially higher total cost of ownership due to their fragmented nature.

How does Hyperautomation help an organization?
The advantages of hyperautomation are limitless. With digital transformation altering traditional business models and evolving customer expectations, enterprises need the right tools to elevate their resources from mundane repetitive tasks. Hyperautomation helps organizations relieve their critical resources from such tasks and make them technology partners and stakeholders in driving core business in an increasingly competitive landscape.

Since Hyperautomation brings the leading automation technologies on a single platform it enables simplifying, automating, and managing the complex workflows within an enterprise.

It can drive significant benefits across the value chain, including increased efficiencies, better customer experience, informed decision making, increase agility and optimized costs.

According to Gartner, by 2024, organizations will lower operational costs by 30% by combining hyperautomation technologies with redesigned operational processes.

Where can we use Hyperautomation?
The purpose of hyperautomation is to make things easier. Collecting all data and processes under a single platform will improve the efficiency of the entire business by combining tasks handled by different departments. Thus, it can be implemented across a wide range of industries, like healthcare, BFSI, Retail, and many more. To state a few examples, hyperautomation can help the healthcare industry provide a better patient-centric care experience with means such as remote monitoring and digital health assistance. Furthermore, inventory management and claims processing can also reduce a sizeable amount of time-consuming manual processing that comes with a heavy cost and labour.

Similarly, when it comes to the retail industry, businesses will find innumerable benefits like personalizing the shopping experience, reducing cart abandonment, warehousing & inventory, supplier management, risk management, and many more when they start leveraging hyperautomation.

What is Modernization?
Modernization means replacing the old legacy technologies with more innovative services that help transform and modernize the IT infrastructure which will alleviate the strain on human resources, give better customer experience and drive business growth.

Legacy core IT systems are often very expensive in terms of maintenance and have huge operational costs. The software also becomes obsolete quite quickly.

To solve the issue, IT modernization which is the re-engineering of business processes can be adopted. This enables innovation, agility, and the creation of new cultures. It also allows having control over various business processes and across various departments, which helps in business growth. It provides companies with the digital services, processes, and reliable business intelligence they need to develop new business models. IT simplification and optimization are the results of modernization.


Why is Modernization important for a business?
IT organizations that rely on legacy applications often face hurdles such as incompatibilities, unnecessary maintenance costs, and a shortage of legacy programmers. This impacts the organization's ability to effectively achieve full digital transformation. Fueling the flames is the integration challenge posed by legacy applications. Traditional applications are difficult to integrate with the latest technologies such as AI, IoT, and the cloud.

To cope with the volatile business scenario, organizations need technological innovations to meet ever-changing customer demands, improve operational efficiency, and contribute to employee satisfaction.

IT Modernization is the backbone of business transformation, and it is important for a business as old legacy systems have some constraints that do not allow businesses to grow. Such as:

Non-Responsive UI
Unstable and Inefficiency
Can’t use emerging technologies
Lack of information
Can’t deploy on cloud
Inflexible architecture
Security risk
Lack of information
Very costly to manage
Lack of user-friendliness


What are the benefits of Modernization to a business?
Today's highly digitized world is changing rapidly. Some technologies become obsolete overnight as new technologies hit the market every day. As technology becomes obsolete, many problems begin to occur, from bugs to lack of support and services, affecting businesses and their customers alike. This is where application modernization plays a key role. This is a solution to bring new life to monolithic applications.

The key benefits of modernization are:

Competitive Advantage: By working on application modernization while your competitors are pondering, you can enjoy the benefits of a good start. By modernizing your applications, you can boost your trust and increase your organization's digital adoption. Modernization allows organizations to integrate the latest platforms and technologies to keep up with competition.

Improved Compatibility: Interoperability improves by updating legacy applications with new-age technology. In addition, organizations can seamlessly integrate applications to meet current and future business needs.

Helps Improve Employee Productivity: In this digital age, everyone wants to upgrade with the latest technology. However, if you are still using older software or technology, employee satisfaction will be reduced, and productivity will be directly impacted. Employees get frustrated by doing the same repetitive work and it does not allow them to be productive. With access to the latest technology, developers and management staff may be more productive than ever before.

Enhanced Customer Experience: It can be both difficult and challenging to use outdated software. Customers may look to find one of your competitors due to bugs, glitches, and delayed application loading. Modern IT ecosystems, on the other hand, have a sophisticated user interface, crucial functionality, and new features. All of this contributes to increased consumer satisfaction and loyalty.

Improved Security: Legacy applications have many security measures that need to be monitored and updated in response to the latest cyber threats. Cyber-attacks can occur without a good security plan to protect your business and its data, and your customers and sensitive data can be lost. It saves a lot of money and provides top-notch security when a company switches to cloud-native applications.

Increase Revenue: Through modernization, businesses can increase their revenue. If a company decides to grow its business, it can add new services or processes that can add value to the needs of its customers. You can use application modernization to add new features or services, to improve the customer experience and increase revenue.

What is Digital Transformation?
Digital Transformation is the process of employing digital solutions to create or modify business processes to meet changing business and market requirements. This involves leveraging technology to enable businesses to achieve growth through enhancing customer experience. The term is not only restricted to technology but delves deeper into formulating a strategy to propel organizations into the digital vanguard.

Gartner defines Digital Transformation as ‘anything from IT modernization (for example, cloud computing), to digital optimization, to the invention of new digital business models.’ The Gartner CIO Agenda 2021 highlighted that 69% of boards report accelerating digital business initiatives in response to COVID-19.

With the changing scenario, organizations adopt Digital Transformation to engage and serve their customers in a more efficient manner, improving their competitiveness in the market. Digital Transformation is imperative to preserve the business and the future of the business.


How is Digital Transformation different from Digitization and Digitalization?
Digitization is converting data and information into a digital form. This conversion into a digital format means that the information can be used by a computer system. This allows extracting information or data that can be processed and analyzed. This means that it also involves the automation of manual and paper-based processes.

On the other hand, Digitalization is employing technologies and digitized data to improve business operations. Digitalization cannot occur without digitization as it embraces the ability of digital technology to capture and assess data to make better business decisions and enable new business models.

Digital Transformation is the holistic implementation of technology across various processes involved in business to ensure fundamental changes. This results in increased efficiency, and improved business agility and thus ensures the satisfaction of employees, customers, and stakeholders. Digital Transformation involves a strategic approach that relies on the integration of digitized data and digitalized applications.


Why is Digital Transformation important for an organization?
Although Digital Transformation revolves around customer experience and has been around since the 1990s, it has evolved with the COVID-19 pandemic. Digital Transformation has become the focal point of operational efficiency and innovation in an organization. As the market dynamics are changing across industries, it has become imperative for organizations to streamline and digitalize operations in terms of the overall strategy of the business.

The need for organizations to re-develop their digital landscape and reinvent their operations through implementing Digital Transformation lead to improved customer acquisition and satisfaction. In the current situation, an organization that does not transform itself digitally to meet the demands of the business landscape will struggle to survive.

Digital Transformation can also be seen as business transformation as it drastically changes the way an organization functions bringing in more transparency and order. A Forrester Consulting research study commissioned by Accenture Interactive found that the key drivers of Digital Transformation are profitability, customer satisfaction, and increased speed-to-market.


What are the key benefits of adopting Digital Transformation for businesses?
It is important for businesses to well understand the benefits that Digital Transformation can bring along. Some of the key advantages are listed below-

Increased Operational Efficiency:: By employing Digital Transformation, an organization’s efficiency will improve as the process gets automated. With a digital approach, businesses can deploy modern technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence. This results in processing data efficiently and providing more insightful results. This eventually aids in offering more effective services to customers.

Increased Productivity: Digital Transformation helps to achieve better productivity as smart technology solutions help businesses maintain their digital transition. The solutions assist in automating specific operations to reduce manual labour, lower expenses, make employee jobs easier, and improve service delivery. This eventually increases productivity.

Improved Customer Experience: Modern customers expect organizations to operate transparently and offer services with a quick turnaround time. The quality of services determines how regularly customers use a service. The use of the right technology solution help in attracting and retaining customers by offering an impeccable experience.

Increased Revenue: A study conducted by MIT found that companies that have embraced Digital Transformation are 26% more profitable than their competitors. As Digital Transformation enables access to cloud systems which help improve customer experience, it eventually results in increasing the revenue of the organization.

It offers services of materials that optimize the supply of a product, packaging that can optimize the effectiveness of the product promotion and logistics that makes it a truly unique provider of supply chain management solutions.

Dot
The Challenges
The client decided to go on to SharePoint online rather than upgrading the on-premise version ad to leverage the PowerApps feature of Office 365.

 

The major challenges involved in the migration to share point online were to redesign the existing process that was based on the legacy system into Office 365. There was a need to migrate data from multiple locations such as SharePoint On-Premise, file servers, shared drives, etc. In addition, the client mainly dealt with material sourcing, global logistics and packaging optimization, hence the solution aimed to be delivered in an efficient way and to enhance performance. The processes were needed to be automated.

 

On the other hand, the challenges involved in Freight Forwarding and Distributions were:

 

Paperwork and manual process for the creation of shipments, sending shipment statuses, invoicing, etc. in SCM Application.
In order to expand the customer base system, need to Integrate with new trading partners who were using the standard and custom EDI (X12, EDIFACT) formats which is the most widely used standard in B2B scenarios.
A lot of customization was required to be done in order to create custom complex schemas (Flat File and XML) using the sample files provided by the external Partners, which was time taking and not efficient and easy to maintain in case of any changes.
Processing of different Excel Templates with custom .NET code in runtime.
For many trading partners based on business requirements, multiple output files must be produced against the received Source File which was quite a complex process.

The Solution implemented for the management of Freight Forwarding & Distributions:
The management of freight forwarding and distribution required synchronization of demand and supply and creating a robust system for efficient delivery of goods.
 
JK Tech implemented an automation framework using BizTalk and Azure Logic Apps that could handle all the message transactions between the client’s application and Trading Partners. The app configured client data format along with the source, destination, parties and agreements. In addition, a customized and standardized EDI solution was being used for multiple trading partners. The communication was made possible for different Trading Partners. The status of the transaction was recorded properly and in case of failure, the reason was also stated. By the Implementation of Azure Cloud Logic Apps, the client developed a capability of public and private API Service Offerings to its existing and new trading partners.
 
Migration to Azure cloud enhanced the capabilities of business users and product owners by providing a real-time view of transactions by integrating with Power BI Dashboard. In addition, using Microsoft Power Automate a process was built, which gave users the capability to re-process any required transactions. Any required failure notification alert was being notified to the Microsoft Teams channel and routed to the Support Portal for immediate action without much delay.

Dot
The Client

Maintaining the application.
Adding new features to the platform.
Long release cycle while the other competitors are able to release new products/features quickly which led to potential business loss.

In the transformed world, the adoption of mobile devices is very high. So it’s very critical for the customer to have all the features being available in mobile devices for better customer interaction with added features like Voyce.

Predictive Modeling Using Corticon BRMS
A leading provider of technology-enabled claim management services, risks & benefits solutions partners with JK Tech & re-engineers and simplifies the business process using Corticon Business Rules Management System (BRMS) and OpenEdge.

Predictive Modeling Using Corticon BRMS
Dot
The Client
The client is the leading provider of technology-enabled claims and productivity management solutions in North America. It also facilitates financial and personal health and helps customers and consumers navigate complexity by designing and implementing customized programs based on proven practices and advanced technologies.

Dot
The Challenges
The client aimed to deliver quality service in areas such as workers’ compensation, liability, property, disability and absence management. The client desired for a solution partner that would not just help them in managing claims but will also simplify the process and reduce the complexities, to achieve operational excellence and making it easy and effective for everyone involved.

 

Their business operations involved a process where a specific dynamic query was used that ran on a monthly basis, in order to extract data related to claims. These extracted file’s information was then used to create Statistical Analysis System (SAS) reports based on a percentile score that helped to identify and distinguish various claims and were analyzed by the supervisors to take appropriate proactive action.

 

The process involved heterogeneous systems and manual intervention, hence they lacked scalability. The categorization of claims followed a 30-day cycle, critical claims were discovered on the 30th day and the high-risk claims were not identified on time. This resulted in a delay of the whole cycle of proactive action. In addition, there was a need to improve the cycle time of the claim process and minimize the manual procedures.

banner
Dot
The Objective
The client being a leading global provider of claim management services, risks and benefits solutions was required to deliver cost-effective risk consulting, managed care and other services. They sought for Predictive Analytics Capability that would help the claim examiners anticipate the likelihood of future events, lowers claim handling costs and help them with more accurate decisioning.

Dot
The Solution
JK Tech re-engineered the business process by converting the existing system into an automated predictive modeling system using Corticon Business Rules Management System (BRMS) and OpenEdge. The focus was on reducing the turnaround time per claim and effective claim management.

 

The redesigned system would check for all open claims in the system and calculate a predictive score as per the rules defined for the predictive analytics model and identify or predict whether a claim belongs to a certain category or not. The new process now ran daily and in case there is any change to any critical claim field, then that claim was recorded. The System was now having the capability to alert the authorized user regarding the potential critical category of the claim.

 

Predictive Modeling removed the heterogeneous systems and the manual interventions were automated with the help of Corticon Studio and Corticon Server using SOAP services. In addition, the current manual process of identifying the high-risk claims was also automated, which helped the business to take proactive decisions and actions which in turn added more value to the business. Predictive Modeling used Corticon as Business Rule Engine to implement the business rule for predicting the high-risk claims and future attorney involvement claims.

 

MAJOR HIGHLIGHT

“The project was awarded in CIO 100 event in Colorado Spring, USA in August, 2017”

Dot
The Client
The client is a leading global provider of technology-enabled risk, benefits and integrated business solutions, located across 65 countries.

Dot
The Challenges
The information for bills & claims was not integrated into one platform. Users spent time running multiple reports to get detailed information on medical bills, claims and payments, various fee information and manually consolidated the data for detailed analysis.
There was no access to near real-time data due to the existing legacy application. This led to a delay in decision-making.
The application used by the client had limited visualization capabilities and was not flexible for self-service reporting.
banner
Dot
The Objective
The client required a powerful analytical tool to unleash valuable insights from the embedded data in the Medical Bill review process. These insights would enable the end customers of the client to elevate their managed care and bill review process to a strategic and data-focused initiative that can drive ongoing program improvements in the organization. The tool needed to have flexible reporting capabilities, along with access to near real-time data.

Dot
The Solution
JK Tech as a solution partner analyzed the end-to-end process and designed a comprehensive bill-centric workflow by bringing the billing and claims data onto one platform. This enabled business users to analyze the key metrics of the bill review process and take the necessary actions to expedite the bill review process effectively. Key highlights of the solution are:

 

Seamless integration of billing information with claims and payments data.
Built Dashboards and reports with information on bill status, expenses, fees, payments to enable analysts and business users to derive key metrics in managed care.
Tightly integrated the solution with data and user security, to ensure data confidentiality.
